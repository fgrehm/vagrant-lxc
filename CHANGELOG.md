## [1.0.0.alpha.2](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v1.0.0.alpha.1...v1.0.0.alpha.2) (May 13, 2014)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - The `sudo_wrapper` provider configuration was removed in favor of using the
    secure wrapper generated by `vagrant lxc sudoers` [[GH-272]]
  - Support for specifying backingstore parameters from `Vagrantfile`s for `lxc-create`
    was added and it defaults to the `best` option. On older lxc versions that does not
    support that value, it needs to be set to `none`.

FEATURES:

  - Add support for specifying backingstore parameters from `Vagrantfile`s [[GH-277]]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Make `dnsmasq` leases MAC address regex check case insensitive [[GH-283]]
  - Use relative paths for `lxc.mount.entry` to avoid issues with `lxc-clone` [[GH-258]].
  - Sort synced folders when mounting [[GH-271]]
  - Privileged ports can now be forwarded with `sudo` [[GH-259]]
  - The `vagrant lxc sudoers` generated sudoers configuration and wrapper script
    are safer and properly whitelists the commands required by vagrant-lxc to run.
    [[GH-272]] / [[GH-269]]

BUG FIXES:

  - Fix `lxc-create` issues with pre 1.0.0 versions [[GH-282]]

## [1.0.0.alpha.1](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.8.0...v1.0.0.alpha.1) (Apr 06, 2014)

DEPRECATIONS:

  - Support to **all Vagrant versions prior to 1.5 are now deprecated**, there is a
    [small layer](lib/vagrant-backports) that ensures compatibility with versions
    starting with 1.1.5 but there is no guarantee that it will stick for too long.
  - Boxes released prior to this version are now deprecated and won't be available
    after the final 1.0.0 release.
  - `--auth-key` argument is no longer provided to `lxc-template`. This will cause
    all official base boxes prior to 09/28/2013 to break.

FEATURES:

  - New `vagrant lxc sudoers` command for creating a policy for users in order to
    avoid `sudo` passwords [[GH-237]] / [[GH-257]]
  - Support for NFS and rsync synced folders.
  - Support for synced folder mount options allowing for using read only synced
    folders [[GH-193]]

[GH-257]: https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/pull/257
[GH-193]: https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/193

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - `lxc-template` is now optional for base boxes and are bundled with the plugin,
    allowing us to roll out updates without the need to rebuild boxes [[GH-254]]
  - Set container's `utsname` to `config.vm.hostname` by default [[GH-253]]
  - Added libvirt dnsmasq leases file to the lookup paths [[GH-251]]
  - Improved compatibility with Vagrant 1.4 / 1.5 including the ability
    to use `rsync` and `nfs` shared folders to work around synced folders
    permission problems. More information can be found on the following
    issues: [[GH-151]] [[GH-191]] [[GH-241]] [[GH-242]]
  - Warn in case `:group` or `:owner` are specified for synced folders [[GH-196]]
  - Acceptance specs are now powered by `vagrant-spec` [[GH-213]]
  - Base boxes creation scripts were moved out to https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc-base-boxes.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (Aug 1, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - To align with Vagrant's core behaviour, forwarded ports are no longer attached
    to 127.0.0.1 and `redir`'s `--laddr` parameter is skipped in case the `:host_ip`
    config is not provided, that means `redir` will listen on connections coming
    from any of the host's IPs.

FEATURES:

  - Properly handle forwarded port collisions [#5](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/5)
  - Container's customizations are now written to the config file (usually
    kept under `/var/lib/lxc/CONTAINER/config`) instead of passed in as a `-s`
    parameter to `lxc-start`

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.3.4...v0.4.0) (Jul 18, 2013)

  - Remove `/tmp` files after the machine has been successfully shut down [#68](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/68)

  - `start_opts` config was renamed to `customize`, please check the README for the expected parameters
  - V1 boxes are no longer supported
  - `target_rootfs_path` is no longer supported, just symlink `/var/lib/lxc` to the desired folder in case you want to point it to another partition
