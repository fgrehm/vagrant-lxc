  - Remove `/tmp` files after the machine has been successfully shut down [#68](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/68)
  - Clean up base boxes files after they've been configured, resulting in smaller packages

## [0.3.3](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3) (April 23, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - Do not display port forwarding message in case no forwarded ports were set

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (April 10, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - Boxes `lxc-template` should support a `--tarball` parameter
  - `start_opts` config was renamed to `customize`, please check the README for the expected parameters
  - V1 boxes are no longer supported
  - `target_rootfs_path` is no longer supported, just symlink `/var/lib/lxc` to the desired folder in case you want to point it to another partition
  - Removed support for configuring private networks. It will come back at some point in the future but if you need it you should be able to set using `customize 'network.ipv4', '1.2.3.4/24'`

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - lxc templates are removed from lxc template dir after container is created
  - Treat NFS shared folders as a normal shared folder instead of ignoring it so we can share the same Vagrantfile with VBox environments
  - Support for lxc 0.7.5 (tested on Ubuntu 12.04) [#49](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/49)
  - Remove `/tmp` files when packaging quantal64 base box [#48](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/48)
  - Avoid picking the best mirror on quantal64 base box [#38](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/38)

BUG FIXES:

  - Redirect `redir`'s stderr output to `/dev/null` [#51](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/51)
  - Switch from `ifconfig` to `ip` to grab container's IP to avoid localization issues [#50](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/50)

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0) (March 30, 2013)
