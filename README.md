[LXC](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/) provider for [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.1+

This is a Vagrant plugin that allows it to control and provision Linux Containers
as an alternative to the built in Vagrant VirtualBox provider for Linux hosts.

Check out this [blog post](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/04/28/lxc-provider-for-vagrant)
to see the plugin in action and find out more about it.

## Features

* Vagrant's `up`, `halt`, `reload`, `destroy`, `ssh`, `provision` and `package` commands
* Shared folders
* Provisioning with any built-in Vagrant provisioner
* Port forwarding
* Setting container's host name

*Please refer to the [closed issues](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=closed)
and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for most up to date information.*


## Requirements

* [Vagrant 1.1+](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
* lxc 0.7.5+
* redir (if you are planning to use port forwarding)
* A [bug-free](#help-im-unable-to-restart-containers) kernel

The plugin is known to work better and pretty much out of the box on Ubuntu 12.04+
hosts and installing the dependencies on it basically means a `apt-get install lxc redir`
and a `apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade` to upgrade the kernel.

Some manual steps are required to set up a Linode machine prior to using this
plugin, please check https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Usage-on-Linode
for more information. The same applies to Debian hosts and documentation will be
provided soon.

If you are on a Mac or Windows machine, you might want to have a look at this
blog post for some ideas on how to set things up: http://the.taoofmac.com/space/HOWTO/Vagrant
or use use the same [Ubuntu 12.10 VirtualBox machine I use for development](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Development#using-virtualbox-for-development).


## Installation

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc
```


## Usage

After installing, add a [base box](#available-boxes) using any name you want, for example:

```
vagrant box add quantal64 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13510779/lxc-quantal-amd64-2013-05-08.box
```

Then create a Vagrantfile that looks like the following, changing the box name
to the one you've just added:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "quantal64"
end
```

And finally run `vagrant up --provider=lxc`.

If you are using Vagrant 1.2+ you can also set `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`
environmental variable to `lxc` in order to avoid typing `--provider=lxc` all
the time.


### Advanced configuration

If you want, you can modify container configurations from within your Vagrantfile
using the [provider block](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/configuration.html):

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "quantal64"
  config.vm.provider :lxc do |lxc|
    # Same effect as as 'customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]' for VirtualBox
    lxc.customize 'cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes', '1024M'
  end
end
```

This will make vagrant-lxc pass in `-s lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes=1024M`
to `lxc-start` when booting containers. This will override any previously value
set from container's configuration file that is usually kept under
`/var/lib/lxc/<container-name>/config`.

For other configuration options, please check [lxc.conf manpages](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/quantal/man5/lxc.conf.5.html).

*Please note that I'm currently using only the quantal x86_64 on a daily basis,
and I've only done some basic testing with the others*

There is a set of [rake tasks](tasks/boxes.rake) that you can use to build base
boxes as needed. By default it won't include any provisioning tool and you can
pick the ones you want by providing some environment variables.

For example:

```
CHEF=1 rake boxes:ubuntu:build:precise64
```

Will build a Ubuntu Precise x86_64 box with Chef pre-installed.


## Current limitations

* The plugin does not detect forwarded ports collision, right now you are
  responsible for taking care of that.
* There is a hell lot of `sudo`s involved and this will probably be around until
  [user namespaces](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LxcSecurity) are supported or I'm able to handle [#90](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/90)
* [Does not tell you if dependencies are not met](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/11)
  (will probably just throw up some random error)
* + bunch of other [core features](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=core&milestone=&page=1&state=open)
  and some known [bugs](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open)
