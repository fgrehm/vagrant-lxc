# vagrant-lxc

Highly experimental, soon to come, Linux Containers support for the unreleased
Vagrant 1.1.

Please refer to the [closed issues](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=closed)
to find out whats currently supported.


## WARNING

Please keep in mind that although I'm already using this on my laptop, this is
"almost alpha" software and things might go wrong.


## Dependencies

LXC, `bsdtar` packages and a Kernel [higher than 3.5.0-17.28](#im-unable-to-restart-containers),
which on Ubuntu 12.10 means:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install lxc bsdtar
```


## What is currently supported?

* Vagrant's `up`, `halt`, `reload`, `destroy`, and `ssh` commands
* Shared folders
* Provisioners
* Setting container's host name
* Host-only / private networking


## Current limitations

* Ruby >= 1.9.3 only, patches for 1.8.7 are welcome
* A hell lot of `sudo`s
* Only a [single ubuntu box supported](boxes), I'm still [figuring out what should go
  on the .box file](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/4)
* "[works](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/20) on [my machine](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/7)" (TM)
* + bunch of other [core features](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=core&milestone=&page=1&state=open)
  and some known [bugs](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open)


## Usage

For now you'll need to install the gem from sources:

```
git clone git://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc.git --recurse
cd vagrant-lxc
bundle install
bundle exec rake install
```

Since Vagrant 1.1 has not been released yet and to avoid messing up with you
current Vagrant installation, I've vendored Vagrant's sources from the master
and made it available from [`vagrant-lxc`](bin/vagrant-lxc). So after installing
`vagrant-lxc`, create a `Vagrantfile` like the one below and run
`vagrant-lxc up --provider=lxc`:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box     = "lxc-quantal64"
  config.vm.box_url = 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13510779/lxc-quantal64-2013-03-08.box'

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest Container. The first argument
  # is the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  config.vm.synced_folder "/tmp", "/host_tmp"

  config.vm.provider :lxc do |lxc|
    # Same as 'customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]' for VirtualBox
    lxc.start_opts << 'lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes=400M'
    # Limits swap size
    lxc.start_opts << 'lxc.cgroup.memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes=500M'
  end

  # ... your puppet / chef / shell provisioner configs here ...
end
```

If you don't trust me and believe that it will mess up with your current Vagrant
installation and / or are afraid that something might go wrong with your machine,
fire up the [same Vagrant VirtualBox machine I'm using for development](#using-virtualbox-for-development)
to try things out and do the same as above. That might also get you up and running
if you are working on a mac or windows host ;)


## Development

If you know what you'll be doing and want to develop from your physical machine,
just sing that same old song:

```
git clone git://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc.git --recurse
cd vagrant-lxc
bundle install
bundle exec rake # to run all specs
```

To rebuild and add the new quantal64 box:

```
bundle exec rake boxes:quantal64:build
vagrant-lxc box add quantal64 boxes/output/lxc-quantal64.box
```


### Using VirtualBox for development

I've also prepared a Vagrant 1.0 VirtualBox machine for development that you can
get up and running with the [`setup-vagrant-dev-box`](setup-vagrant-dev-box)
script. Feel free to use it :)

```
cp Vagrantfile.dev.1.0 Vagrantfile
./setup-vagrant-dev-box
vagrant ssh
```


## Protips

If you want to find out more about what's going on under the hood on vagrant,
prepend `VAGRANT_LOG=debug` to your `vagrant-lxc` commands. For `lxc-start`s
debugging set `LXC_START_LOG_FILE`:

```
LXC_START_LOG_FILE=/tmp/lxc-start.log VAGRANT_LOG=debug vagrant-lxc up
```

This will output A LOT of information on your terminal and some useful information
about `lxc-start` to `/tmp/lxc-start.log`.

Debugging whats going on with the container itself is a pain, there are some
nice little scripts on the [/dev](dev) folder of the project.


## Help!

### I've accidentaly ran `vagrant-lxc` on a Vagrant 1.0 project and I can't use it anymore

That happened to me before so here's how to recover:

```
rm -rf .vagrant
mv .vagrant.v1* .vagrant
```

### I'm unable to restart containers!

It happened to me quite a few times in the past and it seems that it is related
to a bug on linux kernel, so make sure you are using a bug-free kernel
(>= 3.5.0-17.28). More information can be found on:

* https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47181
* https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1021471
* https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1065434

Sometimes the Virtual Box dev machine I'm using is not able to `lxc-start`
containers anymore. Most of the times it was an issue with the [arguments](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/blob/master/lib/vagrant-lxc/container.rb#L85)
[I provided](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/blob/master/example/Vagrantfile#L14-L18)
to it. If you run into that, rollback your changes and try to `vagrant reload`
the dev box. If it still doesn't work, please file a bug at the issue tracker
